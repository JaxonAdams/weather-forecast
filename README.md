# Weather Forecast Dashboard
## Description
This is a weather dashboard app that provides data through the OpenWeather One Call API. Enter a valid zip code in the search bar, and that city's current weather data and five-day-forecast will display to the right. Your searches will be saved between viewing sessions. Upon returning to the webpage, you can use the search history buttons below the form to display that city's weather data again. This is a website designed for desktops and laptops; that being said, a functional (albeit less attractive) layout will be applied when viewed on tablets or phones. I may update the smaller screen layout in the future.
